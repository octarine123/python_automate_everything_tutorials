#assertain

#assertain is a sanity check to make sure your code isn't doing anything obviously wrong
#These sanity checks are performed by assert statements

#If the sanity check fails:
   #then AssertionError raised. In code, an assert statement contains:
                  # assert keyword
                  # conditon (expression evaluating to T or F
                  # comma
                  #string to display conditon upon false

podBayDoorStatus = 'open'
assert podBayDoor == 'open', 'The pod bay doors need to be "open".'
